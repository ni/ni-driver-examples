Example: Simulated Acquisition

Does not require input signal.

Devices Supported: NI 5105, NI 5114, NI 5122, NI 5124, NI 5132,
NI 5133, NI 5142, NI 5152, NI 5153, NI 5154, NI 5160, NI 5162, NI 5185,
NI 5186, NI 5622, NI 5922 (Some devices may require configuring input
impedance, vertical coupling and vertical range.)

Console C Description:

This example creates an instance of a simulated device based on the model
and board type sepecified. Simulation is configured by opening a session
with niScope_InitializeWithOptions and specifing the specific flags in the
option string.

This example displays the simulated waveform, a sine for channel 0 and a
square for channel 1. Errors will be returned for invalid configurations
as if the device was real.

File Locations and Responsibilities:

Each NI-SCOPE example for Console C includes a directory of
files specific to that example.  In addition, each example project
includes a generic .c and .h file located in the
niscope\examples\c\common directory.  These generic files
include all the NI-SCOPE specific programming, and they are used in the
Measurement Studio, CVI, and console C examples.  Many of the examples
also use the asciiPlot.c and asciiPlot.h files located in the common
directory.

The generic files call some externally defined C functions that are
specific for the development environment, such as the PlotWaveform
function that displays the acquired waveform.  For console C programs,
these functions are very simple.  They either prompt the user for input
or hard code certain values.  However, each example should provide
enough feedback to illustrate that the example is working properly.

Each example includes both a Visual C++ 6.0 project file and an
auto-generated make file for building the example.
